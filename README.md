This package allows you to quickly create a multi-window application using [astilectron](https://github.com/asticode/go-astilectron).

Check out the [demo](https://github.com/asticode/go-astilectron-demo) to see a working example with the [bundler](https://github.com/asticode/go-astilectron-bundler).

# Important

- by default all resources should be in a `resources` folder. If you want to put them in a different folder, be sure to provide its path with the `ResourcesPath` option
- if one of your window's URL is a relative path you will need to put your app content in an `app` folder located in your resources folder
